* Project Manager
This just a small tool that I use to manage the small projects that
are scattered over my computer. Feel free to try it!
* Installation
Currently, the only way to install it is using nix:
~nix-env -i -f default.nix~
* Usage
~pm help~
* Todos
- Add tags support
- Add sqlite database to keep track of more info
- Handle remote projects (ssh)
- GNU Readline integration for autocompletion
- Hooks for running a certain operation on multiple projects 
  (i.e. cleaning node modules for all the node repos)
- Spawn a (nix)shell for a project
- Create project layout from a template (TOML rather than JSON or YAML)
